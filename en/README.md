# 🛰️ Sepolia RPC Node Installer All in one

🇷🇺 [for Russian](https://github.com/pittpv/sepolia-auto-install/blob/main/ "Russian version of description")

![First screen](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pittpv/sepolia-auto-install/main/other/img-en-2025-05-22-15-29-52.png)

An interactive bash script for installing, managing and monitoring an Ethereum Sepolia node with support for choosing an execution client (Geth (recommended), Reth, Nethermind) and a consensus client (Prysm (recommended), Lighthouse, Teku), synchronization monitoring and a cron agent with notifications about the node's status in Telegram.

## 📦 Features

* 📦 System update and prerequisites install
* 🔧 Install and run Sepolia node with selected consensus client
* 🐳 Automatically generate `docker-compose.yml`
* 📊 Check sync status (execution and consensus)
* 📋 View logs
* 🔄 Update containers
* 🛑 Stop/start containers
* 🧹 Remove the node
* 💽 Analyze disk usage
* 📡 Install cron-agent with Telegram status notifications
* 🔥 Advanced Firewall Management
* 🌐 RPC and blob data check. Script created by `@web3.creed` (Discord)
* ⚙️ Configuring resource usage for Docker containers

**Check out the Version History under the spoiler, there is a lot of useful information about the functions of the script.**

## ⚙️ Requirements

* `docker` and `docker-compose`
* `curl`, `jq`
* `bash` ≥ 4.0

All prerequisites can be installed automatically by selecting option 1 in the menu. This will update the system and current applications, install Docker, Docker Compose, and other required utilities. After installation, the system will be cleaned of installation cache and unused packages.

> I recommend using step 1 even if you have Docker. The script will skip installing the components you have. After upgrading your system, **check** if your old containers and other nodes are still running.

### 🖥️ System Requirements

| Component          | Requirement                        |
|--------------------|------------------------------------|
| **OS**             | Ubuntu 20.04 or later              |
| **RAM**            | 16 GB and more                     |
| **CPU**            | 8 cores and more                   |
| **Disk**           | 800 GB SSD (can grow up to 1.5 TB) |

## 📌 Latest Updates 01-09-2025
- Added an option that allows configuring CPU and RAM usage limits for EL and CL clients.
  - When this option is enabled, 20% of the server’s operating system resources are always reserved. The remaining resources are divided in a 60:40 ratio between EL and CL clients.
  - The option is automatically activated when installing the RPC node (you can opt out of setting limits) or can be launched separately on an already running node (requires a restart of the node containers).

## 🚀 Installation & Run

**Launch or Update**

```bash
curl -o install_sepolia.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pittpv/sepolia-auto-install/main/install_sepolia.sh && chmod +x install_sepolia.sh && ./install_sepolia.sh
````

For future runs:

```bash
cd $HOME && ./install_sepolia.sh
```

After installing the node, wait for the full synchronization. The synchronization will be complete only when you see "✅ Execution synchronized" when you query the synchronization status. Otherwise, even if you see 100%, the synchronization is not yet complete.

## 📋 Main Menu

The script offers the following menu (available in English or Russian):

1. Install requirements (Docker, etc.)
2. Install node
3. Update containers
4. View logs
5. Check sync status
6. Set up cron agent with Tg notifications
7. Remove cron agent
8. Stop containers
9. Start containers
10. Delete node
11. Change ports for installed node
12. Check disk usage
13. Firewall management
14. Check RPC server
15. Configure Docker resources
0. Exit

## 🔐 Telegram Notifications

The script includes a cron-agent that monitors node status and sends alerts via Telegram.

### Setup:

1. Get a Telegram bot token from [BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather)
2. Find your `chat_id` using [IDBot](https://t.me/myidbot) or similar
3. Enter the token and chat\_id during cron-agent setup

Choose the notification interval:

* Every 5, 10, 15, 30 minutes, or hourly

## 🧠 Supported Clients

The following configurations have been tested:

| Execution / Consensus  | Prysm     | Teku      | Lighthouse                                              |
|------------------------|-----------|-----------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| **Geth**               | ✅  | ✅   | ⚠️ |
| **Reth**               | ✅  | ✅   | ⚠️                                          |
| **Nethermind**         | ✅  | ✅   | ⚠️                                         |

**Legend:**

* ✅ — works with default ports / works with custom ports
* ⚠️ — works, but recommended consensus client P2P port modification, must be **changed from 9000**

## 📡 Sync Monitoring

Depending on the client, a different algorim is used to display the synchronization status.

### Execution Client Sync Status Capabilities

The script displays:

| Feature                           | Geth | Reth | Nethermind |
|-----------------------------------|------|------|------------|
| Current & Target Block            | ✅   | ✅   | ✅         |
| Sync Progress (%)                 | ✅   | ✅   | ✅         |
| Sync Stage                        | ❌   | ✅   | ✅         |
| Sync Speed (blocks/sec)          | ✅   | ❌   | ❌         |
| Estimated Time to Completion     | ✅   | ❌   | ❌         |
| Sync Completed Status            | ✅   | ✅   | ✅         |

### Consensus Client Sync Status Capabilities

The script displays:

| Feature                       | Prysm | Teku | Lighthouse |
|-------------------------------|-------|------|------------|
| Current & Target Block        | ✅    | ✅   | ✅         |
| Sync In Progress              | ✅    | ✅   | ✅         |
| Sync Completed Status         | ✅    | ✅   | ✅         |

## 🔗 RPC links

* RPC URL: `http://localhost:8545` (default port is `8545`, or another port you set)
* BEACON RPC URL: `http://localhost:5052` (default port is `5052`, or another port you set)

replace localhost with the IP address of your server.

## 🔥 Firewall Management

This feature adds a menu to manage the UFW & IPTABLES on your server. It helps secure your node by controlling access to important ports.
For detailed information about the Firewall Management function, please see: [Firewall-Manager.md](https://github.com/pittpv/sepolia-auto-install/blob/main/en/Firewall-Manager.md "Description of the Firewall Management function in English")

### Menu Items

1. **Enable and prepare (ufw, iptables)**
   Opens SSH ports (22, `ssh`), enables UFW, configures iptables.
   If UFW is already active or iptables rules exist, the script will notify you.

2. **Port management**
   Add/remove rules by number. All directions and protocols. Option to block all incoming connections.

3. **IP address management**
   Add/remove rules by number. IP address with port specification, all directions and protocols.

4. **View all rules**
   Displays DOCKER-USER chain and UFW rules.

5. **Reset all rules and restart Docker**
   Removes DOCKER-USER and UFW rules, disables UFW, restarts Docker to restore default rules.

### Key Features

* All critical operations require **explicit confirmation** to minimize errors.
* Includes duplicate rule prevention.
* Ensures proper rule deletion/addition sequencing.

## 🌐 RPC and Blob Data Check

The function checks RPC availability and the presence of blob data for the last slots

🔍 What the check does:

* Detects the server's external IP address
* Checks availability of Execution RPC and Beacon RPC
* Requests the latest block and client version
* Verifies the presence of blob data for the last 10 slots

✅ Status is determined by the percentage of slots containing blob data:

* `HEALTHY`: ≥75%
* `WARNING`: 25–74%
* `CRITICAL`: <25%

Useful for diagnosing and ensuring that the node correctly processes data with EIP-4844 (blobs).

## 🗑️ Removal

The removal option completely wipes all node data and containers. Confirmation is required.
